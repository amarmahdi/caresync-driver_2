Of course. Now that we have the essential data structures and the eligibility filter in place, the next logical step is to group the children into manageable zones for each potential route. This is the clustering phase.

Here is the detailed, step-by-step markdown file for **Module 2 of Phase 2**.

---

# Phase 2, Module 2: Geographic & Categorical Clustering

## 1. Objective

The goal of this module is to implement the clustering logic that groups children into sensible "workloads" before we try to find the optimal path for each. This involves two layers of grouping: first by **category** (infants, toddlers, etc.) to ensure similar needs are handled together, and then by **geography** to create compact zones. This step is critical for breaking down a large, complex problem into smaller, solvable pieces.

## 2. Technical Stack

-   **Backend:** TypeScript
-   **Clustering Library:** `node-kmeans` - a simple and effective library for implementing the k-means clustering algorithm in Node.js.

## 3. Step-by-Step Instructions

### ☐ **Step 1: Install the Clustering Library**

1.  In your backend project directory, install the `node-kmeans` package.
    ```bash
    npm install node-kmeans
    ```
    *Note: This library may not have official TypeScript types, so we will work with it using standard JavaScript patterns.*

### ☐ **Step 2: Create the Clustering Service**

We will create a new service file dedicated to the clustering logic.

1.  Create a new file in your services folder: `src/services/clusteringService.ts`.
2.  This service will contain the logic to first separate children by their `category` and `eligibility`, and then run the k-means algorithm on their coordinates.

### ☐ **Step 3: Implement Categorical Grouping**

Before we can cluster geographically, we must group children who can be serviced by the same types of drivers and vehicles.

1.  Open `src/services/clusteringService.ts` and start by defining the structure of our output and the first grouping function.

    ```typescript
    // src/services/clusteringService.ts
    import { Child } from '../entities/Child';
    import { EligibilityMap } from './eligibilityService';

    // A "workload" is a group of children that can be serviced by the same set of drivers/vehicles.
    export interface Workload {
      // A unique key representing the set of eligible drivers/vehicles (e.g., "infant_certified_drivers")
      // For simplicity, we can serialize the list of eligible driver IDs.
      key: string; 
      children: Child[];
    }

    /**
     * Groups children based on their eligible transport options. All children in a group
     * must share at least one common driver/vehicle pair that can service them all.
     * @param children The list of children to group.
     * @param eligibilityMap The map generated from the eligibilityService.
     * @returns An array of Workloads, where each workload contains children with compatible needs.
     */
    export function groupChildrenByEligibility(
      children: Child[],
      eligibilityMap: EligibilityMap
    ): Workload[] {
      const workloadsMap = new Map<string, Child[]>();

      for (const child of children) {
        const eligibleOptions = eligibilityMap.get(child);
        if (!eligibleOptions || eligibleOptions.length === 0) {
          console.warn(`Child ${child.name} has no eligible transport options and will be skipped.`);
          continue;
        }

        // Create a unique, sorted key from the IDs of eligible drivers.
        // This ensures that children who can be picked up by the same set of drivers
        // are grouped together.
        const key = eligibleOptions
          .map(option => option.driver.id)
          .sort()
          .join(',');

        if (!workloadsMap.has(key)) {
          workloadsMap.set(key, []);
        }
        workloadsMap.get(key)!.push(child);
      }

      // Convert the map to the Workload array structure
      const workloads: Workload[] = [];
      workloadsMap.forEach((children, key) => {
        workloads.push({ key, children });
      });

      return workloads;
    }
    ```

### ☐ **Step 4: Implement Geographic Clustering (K-Means)**

Now, for each `Workload`, we will subdivide it into geographic clusters.

1.  **Add the K-Means logic** to `src/services/clusteringService.ts`. We need to estimate the number of buses (`k`) needed for each workload. A simple heuristic is to divide the number of children by the average vehicle capacity.

    ```typescript
    // Add to src/services/clusteringService.ts
    import { kmeans } from 'node-kmeans'; // This might show a type error, which is okay

    // A "Cluster" is a geographically grouped subset of a Workload. This is what becomes a Route.
    export type Cluster = Child[];

    const AVERAGE_VEHICLE_CAPACITY = 10; // This should be a configurable value

    /**
     * Takes a workload and subdivides it into geographic clusters using k-means.
     * @param workload The workload to cluster.
     * @returns A promise that resolves to an array of clusters (arrays of children).
     */
    export function clusterWorkloadGeographically(workload: Workload): Promise<Cluster[]> {
      return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        if (workload.children.length === 0) {
          return resolve([]);
        }

        // Prepare the data for k-means: an array of [lat, lon] vectors.
        const vectors = workload.children.map(child => [child.latitude, child.longitude]);
        
        // Estimate the number of clusters (k) needed.
        // At least 1 cluster, and at most the number of children.
        const k = Math.max(
          1,
          Math.min(
            Math.ceil(workload.children.length / AVERAGE_VEHICLE_CAPACITY),
            workload.children.length
          )
        );

        if (k === 1) {
            // If only one cluster is needed, no need to run k-means.
            return resolve([workload.children]);
        }

        kmeans.clusterize(vectors, { k }, (err: any, res: any) => {
          if (err) {
            console.error("K-means clustering error:", err);
            return reject(err);
          }
          
          // Map the k-means result back to our Child objects.
          const clusters: Cluster[] = res.map((cluster: any) => 
            cluster.clusterInd.map((vectorIndex: number) => workload.children[vectorIndex])
          );
          
          resolve(clusters);
        });
      });
    }
    ```

### ☐ **Step 5: Integrate Clustering into the `generateRoutes` Mutation**

Let's update our main resolver in `routeResolvers.ts` to use the new clustering service.

1.  Open `src/graphql/resolvers/routeResolvers.ts`.
2.  Import and use the new clustering functions after the eligibility filter.

    ```typescript
    // src/graphql/resolvers/routeResolvers.ts
    // ... other imports
    import { groupChildrenByEligibility, clusterWorkloadGeographically } from '../../services/clusteringService';

    // ... inside the generateRoutes mutation ...
    export const routeResolvers = {
      // ... Query ...
      Mutation: {
        generateRoutes: async (_: any, { date, childrenIds }: { date: string; childrenIds: string[] }) => {
          // ... (Step 1: Fetch data & Step 2: Eligibility Filter from Module 1) ...
          
          // --- NEW: Step 3: Group by Eligibility & Category ---
          const workloads = groupChildrenByEligibility(childrenToRoute, eligibilityMap);

          // --- NEW: Step 4: Geographically Cluster Each Workload ---
          const allClusters: any[] = [];
          for (const workload of workloads) {
            console.log(`--- Processing Workload (${workload.children.length} children) ---`);
            const geoClusters = await clusterWorkloadGeographically(workload);
            allClusters.push(...geoClusters);
          }

          // --- FOR VALIDATION PURPOSES IN THIS MODULE ---
          console.log("\n--- Geographic Clustering Results ---");
          allClusters.forEach((cluster, index) => {
            console.log(`Cluster #${index + 1}: Contains ${cluster.length} children`);
            cluster.forEach((child: Child) => {
              console.log(`  -> ${child.name} at (${child.latitude}, ${child.longitude})`);
            });
          });
          // ---------------------------------------------
          
          // TODO in next module:
          // 5. For each cluster, find the optimal stop order (routing).
          // 6. Create and save Route and Stop entities.

          // For now, return an empty array as a placeholder
          return [];
        },
      },
    };
    ```

### ☐ **Step 6: Validate the Clustering Logic**

1.  **Prepare Test Data:** Using your Admin Panel, ensure you have geocoded coordinates for at least 15-20 children.
    -   Create a distinct group of 8-10 children in one corner of the map (e.g., "North Zone").
    -   Create another group of 8-10 children in a different corner (e.g., "South Zone").
    -   Make sure some of these children are `INFANT`s and some are `TODDLER`s to test the categorical grouping. Ensure you have corresponding eligible drivers/vehicles.
2.  **Run the Mutation:** Go to the GraphQL Playground and run the `generateRoutes` mutation, providing the IDs of all 20 test children.
3.  **Check Backend Console Logs:** Observe the console output. You should see:
    -   First, logs from the Eligibility Filter (from the previous module).
    -   Then, a log for "Processing Workload". You might see one workload for infants and another for toddlers.
    -   Finally, the "Geographic Clustering Results".
        -   You should see multiple clusters.
        -   Crucially, the children within each cluster should be geographically close to each other. The "North Zone" children should be in one cluster, and the "South Zone" children in another.
        -   The size of each cluster should be around the `AVERAGE_VEHICLE_CAPACITY` you defined (e.g., ~10 children per cluster).

## 4. Final Deliverables for this Module

-   A new `clusteringService.ts` file containing logic for both categorical and geographical grouping.
-   The `node-kmeans` library added as a dependency.
-   The main `generateRoutes` resolver is updated to perform the clustering step after the eligibility check.
-   Successful validation of the clustering logic, demonstrated by console logs showing that children are correctly grouped first by their needs and then by their proximity on the map. The system now produces logical, self-contained "route assignments" (the clusters).
